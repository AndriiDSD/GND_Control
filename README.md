GND_Control - a ground control station build using Java.
This ground control software remotely controls drones using the [MAVLink protocol](http://qgroundcontrol.org/mavlink/start).
The control can be done using mission planning or interactively using keyboard. The software can connect to 
SITL using TCP or UDP. It adds a profile functionality to save different drone settings.
